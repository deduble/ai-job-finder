  "description": "THE CHALLENGE\n\nAs Eventbrite continues to grow and expand its reach, the challenge of protecting our users from bad actors, collusion, inappropriate content, and financial fraud and abuse becomes increasingly important. The Risk & Fraud Engineering team works behind the scenes to ensure our creators get paid and our attendees find amazing events. Keeping ahead of fraudsters requires a balance of proactivity and reactivity and the agility to switch focus when necessary. Our Engineers make sure we keep up without our customers noticing by designing low profile data-drive solutions to the ever-changing landscape of threats.\n\nIf the idea of working on one of the highest impact teams at Eventbrite whose problem space is constantly evolving excites you, we want to hear from you!\n\nTHE TEAM\n\nThe Risk and Fraud team is a crosscutting team that owns a platform with connections to many different parts of Eventbrite’s site. We protect everything from account creation to event payout, and we have the opportunity to impact the success of all parts of the company. The team is cross-functional, with software engineers, data scientists, data analysts, product managers and an engineering manager working together to tackle these complex problems in creative ways. We value collaboration, both with each other and with other teams, clear and proactive communication, opportunities to learn, as well as biases for action.\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nAs a Sr. Software Engineer, you will be responsible for building and maintaining the risk and fraud platform, including the interfaces with models built by data scientists and with client code, as well as helping us plan for the future technological path for our tech stack. You will have the opportunity to learn from Staff Engineers and Data Scientists, as well as to mentor junior engineers. You will also be part of the team’s on-call program.\n\nTHE TECH STACK\n\nThe existing tech stack is primarily written in Python with a Django framework, with some components written in TypeScript, all hosted on AWS. Other technologies we use include MySQL, DynamoDB, lambda, CDK, OpenSearch, Celery, Snowflake, Airflow, and SageMaker. You will also be a part of influencing the technical direction for the next iteration of our platform.\n\nThe Skillset\n\n\n * You have 4+ years of experience building low latency software applications to scale\n * You have strong experience in high level languages such as Python, TypeScript\n * You have experience working with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure\n * You have experience working with both SQL and NoSQL DBs\n * You write testable, maintainable code\n * You have a bias for action and can deliver autonomously\n * You are a strong communicator and comfortable working with a wide range of stakeholders in different functional areas\n * You enjoy mentoring and being mentored\n * You write excellent documentation\n   \n   \n\nBONUS POINTS FOR\n\n\n * You enjoy working in a cross functional team\n * You have experience in an anti-abuse space in e-commerce, especially in marketplace companies, such as fraud, spam, content policy or trust and safety\n * You have experience in data engineering\n   \n   \n\nPAY TRANSPARENCY\n\nThe wage range for this role takes into account the wide range of factors that are considered in making compensation decisions including but not limited to skill sets; experience and training; licensure and certifications; and other business and organizational needs. The disclosed range estimate has not been adjusted for the applicable geographic differential associated with the location at which the position may be filled. At Eventbrite, it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range for their role and compensation decisions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case. A reasonable estimate of the current range is listed below. You may also be eligible to participate in Eventbrite’s incentive program(s) (such as equity, annual incentive bonus and commission plans), subject to the applicable rules and restrictions.\n\nPay Transparency Range (US)\n\n$127,300—$229,100 USD\n\nAbout Eventbrite\n\nAt Eventbrite everyone is invited to be their whole self and we cultivate an environment to make sure that is feasible throughout the entirety of an individual's time at Eventbrite.

Read more about our Diversity and Inclusion work for our team, culture, and community.\n\nBenefits\n\nWe offer comprehensive benefits and a wellness package above and beyond standard medical benefits to support our Britelings’ lifestyle.\n\nEventbrite's global benefit programs are designed to meet you where you are by offering resources and support for your health, well-being, finances, and family.
